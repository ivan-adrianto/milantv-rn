## Try the app
If you want to try the app quickly, I have apk files that has been connected to deployed MilanTV server at https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bEjd7lNHVNLUT8kroR3wAFvQ9drRM06/view?usp=sharing .
However, if you want to run this project locally, you need to clone and then run the MilanTV server (https://github.com/ivan-adrianto/milantv-api) first.

## Happy review
