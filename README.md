# MilanTV

## Features
MilanTV is a mobile app in which users can give reviews to moviews, as well as seeing other user's reviews. User can also update and delete their reviews in this mobile app.
Besides that, user can also update their profile, including names,usernames, and profile photo.

## Try the app
If you want to try the app quickly, I have apk files that has been connected to deployed MilanTV server at https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bEjd7lNHVNLUT8kroR3wAFvQ9drRM06/view?usp=sharing .
However, if you want to run this project locally, you need to clone and then run the MilanTV server (https://github.com/ivan-adrianto/milantv-api) first.

## Happy review
